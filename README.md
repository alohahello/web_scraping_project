# Development Environment
Javascript is the tool that I use to develop this program. It was use the Puppeteer Node.js library maintained by the Chrome team at Google. Puppeteer provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol, allowing developers to control headless (without a graphical user interface) or full (with a graphical user interface) versions of the Google Chrome or Chromium browsers. 

I was also use the "fs" (File System) module is a built-in module in Node.js that provides functionality for interacting with the file system. It allows you to perform various operations on files and directories, such as reading from or writing to files, creating and deleting directories, and more.
