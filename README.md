This is a web scraping program designed to extract data from specific pages, such as Amazon. It operates by gathering information from the HTML code of web pages using a script. This process allows for the collection, analysis, and storage of data from the website for various purposes, including research, analysis, or integration into other applications.

# Development Environment
JavaScript is the primary tool I utilized to develop this program. I employed the Puppeteer Node.js library, maintained by the Chrome team at Google. Puppeteer offers a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol, enabling developers to control either headless (without a graphical user interface) or full (with a graphical user interface) versions of the Google Chrome or Chromium browsers.

Additionally, I utilized the "fs" (File System) module, a built-in module in Node.js, providing functionality for interacting with the file system. This module enables various operations on files and directories, such as reading from or writing to files, creating and deleting directories, and more.
